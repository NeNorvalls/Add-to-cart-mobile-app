# Reel Time Web App

This repository contains the source code for the Reel Time web application, which allows users to create and manage a shopping list. The application is built using HTML, CSS, and Firebase Realtime Database for data storage.

## Features

- Users can add items to their shopping list.
- Items can be removed from the list by double-clicking on them.
- The application provides real-time synchronization of the shopping list across multiple users.

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript (with ES6 modules)
- Firebase Realtime Database

## Code Explanation

### HTML Structure

The HTML structure of the web application consists of a simple layout with an input field, a button to add items to the shopping list, and a list to display the items. Additionally, the necessary meta tags and links to external resources are included in the `<head>` section.

### CSS Styling

The CSS stylesheet (`styles.css`) provides styling for the various elements of the web application, including the layout, input field, button, and shopping list items. The styling ensures a visually appealing and user-friendly interface.

### JavaScript Functionality

The JavaScript code (`script.js`) handles the functionality of the web application. It interacts with the Firebase Realtime Database to store and retrieve the shopping list items. Event listeners are set up to respond to user actions such as adding items to the list and removing items by double-clicking.
